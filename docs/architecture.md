# System Architecture

## Overview

The Stock Trading AI system is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components while maintaining efficient communication between them. This document details the system's architecture and the interaction between its components.

## Core Components

### 1. DQN Agent (src/models/dqn_agent.py)
The neural network-based agent that makes trading decisions:
- **Architecture**: Multi-layer perceptron
- **Input Processing**: Normalizes market data and indicators
- **Decision Making**: Q-value computation for actions
- **Learning**: Experience replay and target network updates

### 2. Trading Environment (src/env/trading_env.py)
The simulation environment that interfaces with the agent:
- **State Management**: Tracks market conditions and portfolio
- **Action Processing**: Executes trading decisions
- **Reward Calculation**: Evaluates trading performance
- **Constraint Handling**: Enforces trading rules and limits

### 3. Data Processing (src/data/)
Handles all data-related operations:
- **Market Data**: Real-time and historical price data
- **Technical Analysis**: Indicator calculation and updates
- **Data Validation**: Quality checks and preprocessing
- **Caching**: Efficient data storage and retrieval

### 4. Visualization System (src/utils/)
Provides real-time visual feedback:
- **Interactive Charts**: Price and indicator plots
- **Performance Metrics**: Trading statistics display
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic data visualization
- **Export Capabilities**: Save and share analysis

## Component Interactions

### Data Flow
1. Market data flows from Yahoo Finance to Data Processing
2. Processed data feeds into Trading Environment
3. Environment state is passed to DQN Agent
4. Agent's actions return to Environment
5. Results flow to Visualization System

### Communication Protocols
- **Data Processing → Environment**: DataFrame updates
- **Environment → Agent**: State vectors
- **Agent → Environment**: Action integers
- **Environment → Visualization**: Event-driven updates

## System Requirements
